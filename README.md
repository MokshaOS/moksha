# Moksha OS
Moksha Operating System is a 16 – bit Operating System developed in Assembly Language for x86 based processors. Which can be controlled from a interactive console. Currently the Moksha Operating System is operational from a 1.44 MB, 3.5 inch floppy disk(We know they are extinct now but, nevertheless you can use your spare hard drive to test it). Moksha OS depends on a 16 – bit File System know as MFAT 16 ( Moksha File Allocation Table 16 ) for file management.
